# Debug notes
# -it --entrypoint=/bin/sh

# Special properties of the container pentext generation
# * rootless podman
# * readonly filesystem except for the target folder
# * extra noexec flags
# * disable networking for the container
# * dropped root privileges inside container (defined there)
# * direct passthrough of uid permissions to container
# * do not keep persistent container results

# TODO --uidmap=0:0:1000 or similar for additional separation of rootless container id

# Note that there are no special resource limitations on the container,
# since resource exhaustion attacks are secondary concerns (for now)
